## Pre-requisites

* An IDE or text editor of your choice
* [Sqlite3](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)

* TechSpecs - SQLlite, Java Springboots mocroservices, Angular TypeScript, docker etc.


## Task
Your task is to create an API on top of a couple different databases.  It should conform to the user stories provided below.  You are free to use whatever language you prefer, however our tech stack features NodeJS, Java and Ruby. If you're comfortable with any of these, try to favor them.  Google andÂ the interwebs are at your disposal.

**The Databases**
The databases are provided as a SQLite3 database in `db/`.  It does not require any credentials to login.  You can run SQL queries directly against the database using:

```
sqlite <path to db file>
```

`.tables` will return a list of available tables and `.schema <table>` will provide the schema.

## Considerations
When developing your solution, please consider the following:

* Structure of your endpoints - Can you easily extend the API to support new endpoints as feature requests come in?
* Quality of your code - Does your code demonstrate the use of design patterns?
* Testability - Is your code testable?
* Can your solution be easily configured and deployed?  Consider guidelines from [12 Factor App](http://12factor.net/)
